# base-images

> pipelines to sync, build and scan containers that are vendored or built for GeoNet

# Purpose

- sync to vendor images
- build container images
- run security scans again each destination image in configuration
- separate implementation from the data
  - implementation can be swapped out underneath, if need be and maintain the function

The repo is mostly concerned with base images or images used in build processes.

# Features

- declarative image sync management, given source and destination
- declarative apko build management
  - with Melange (Alpine APK building) integration
  - generated SBOMs
  - container image signing
- automatic security scanning for each image synced and built
- multiple build modes
  - apko
  - apko + melange
  - docker (fallback)
- automatic trigger of builds, sync and scan every week

# Layout

the structure of the repo is as follows:

- `config.yaml`: define configuration about runtime
- `images/NAME/{images.yaml|Dockerfile,*}`: images to build configurations
- `.github/workflows/{sync,scan,build}.yml`: lifecycle actions

# Usage

## Sync an image

Images are synced by specifying source and destinations like this

```yaml
sync:
  - source: docker.io/alpine:latest
    destination: ghcr.io/somecoolorg/images/alpine:latest
```

Images will only be synced if the digest of the source and destination don't match or if the `sync[].always` key is set to `true`

## Build with apko

Images for building are specified with the source being an apko formatted YAML file and an image destination

```yaml
build:
  - source: ./images/acoolthing/image.yaml
    destination: ghcr.io/somecoolorg/images/acoolthing:latest
```

with `./images/acoolthing/image.yaml` being something like this

```yaml
contents:
  repositories:
    - https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.17/main
    - https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.17/community
  packages:
    - alpine-base
    - busybox
    - ca-certificates-bundle

entrypoint:
  command: /bin/sh -c

archs:
- x86_64
- aarch64
```

## Build with apko and Melange

Specify a source, destination and as many melangeConfigs

```yaml
build:
  - source: ./images/coolthing/image.yaml
    destination: ghcr.io/somecoolorg/images/coolthing:latest
    melangeConfigs:
      - ./images/coolthing/pkg-hello.yaml
```

with each melange config being a path to the package to build.
An entry in the apko YAML must be set `contents.repositories[last index]` to `@local /github/workspace/packages`, then packages can be installed with `NAME@local`; like this apko configuration

```yaml
contents:
  repositories:
    - https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.17/main
    - https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.17/community
    - '@local /github/workspace/packages'
  packages:
    - alpine-base
    - busybox
    - ca-certificates-bundle
    - hello@local

entrypoint:
  command: /bin/sh -c

archs:
- x86_64
```

## Build with Docker

Only use this if you have to. It is better to build with apko.

Images can be built with Docker like this

```yaml
build:
  - source: ./images/oldschool/Dockerfile
    destination: ghcr.io/somecoolorg/images/oldschool:latest
    dockerOptions:
      context: ./images/oldschool
```

# Tips

## What is an image ref?

IMAGE_REF refers to an image reference in the format of either
- ghcr.io/somecoolorg/images/hello:latest (just a tag)
- ghcr.io/somecoolorg/images/hello@sha256:a61743b19423a01827ba68a1ec81a09d04f84bc69848303905ecbc73824fb88b (just a digest)
- ghcr.io/somecoolorg/images/hello:latest@sha256:a61743b19423a01827ba68a1ec81a09d04f84bc69848303905ecbc73824fb88b (a tag and a digest)

## Obtaining a digest

the digest can be obtained through

```shell
crane digest IMAGE_REF
```

to use it, it can be included when an image ref is formatted like the examples above in _What is an image ref?_.

## Tagging built images

determine the digest of the image, for example given the image is `ghcr.io/somecoolorg/images/hello:latest`
``` shell
crane digest ghcr.io/somecoolorg/images/hello:latest
```

the digest might be `sha256:a61743b19423a01827ba68a1ec81a09d04f84bc69848303905ecbc73824fb88b`.

add a new sync image to the sync key like
```yaml
  - source: ghcr.io/somecoolorg/images/hello@sha256:a61743b19423a01827ba68a1ec81a09d04f84bc69848303905ecbc73824fb88b
    destination: ghcr.io/somecoolorg/images/hello:some-cool-tag
```

## Verifying images

Images are signed using `cosign` with [keyless](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/keyless/), this means that 
- signatures depend on the build or key infrastructure
- there's no worry of key rotation

Images are able to be verified through

```shell
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/GeoNet/base-images/.github/workflows/(sync|build).yml@refs/heads/.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  IMAGE_REF
```

please note: the _certificate identity_ field will vary between
- https://github.com/GeoNet/base-images/.github/workflows/sync.yml@refs/heads/main
- https://github.com/GeoNet/base-images/.github/workflows/build.yml@refs/heads/main

## See the tree of attached signatures and SBOMs

produces a nice and readible tree of signatures, attestations and SBOMs related to the IMAGE_REF
```shell
cosign tree IMAGE_REF
```

## View the SBOM in the attestation

verify the attestation
```shell
cosign verify-attestation \
  --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/GeoNet/base-images/.github/workflows/(sync|build).yml@refs/heads/.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  IMAGE_REF
```

since SBOMs are the predicate of a signed attestation instead of just uploaded, it requires an extra layer to retrieve their content
```shell
cosign verify-attestation IMAGE_REF --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/GeoNet/base-images/.github/workflows/(sync|build.yml@refs/heads/.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com | jq -r .payload | base64 -d | jq -r .predicate.Data
```

using [sigs.k8s.io/bom](https://sigs.k8s.io/bom), the SBOM attestation can be visualised

```shell
🐚 cosign verify-attestation IMAGE_REF --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/GeoNet/base-images/.github/workflows/(sync|build).yml@refs/heads/.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com | jq -r .payload | base64 -d | jq -r .predicate.Data | bom document outline -

Verification for ghcr.io/GeoNet/base-images/hello:latest --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:

# Patterns for discussion

> semi-related topics

- require signed container images for use in production
  - https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/sign
  - https://kyverno.io/policies/other/verify_image
  - https://docs.sigstore.dev/policy-controller/overview
- use distroless container images as base images
  - don't ship package managers into production
  - https://github.com/chainguard-images
- run containers as non-root users
  - limit workload privilege
  - https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/blob/main/docs/apko_file.md#accounts-top-level-element
  - set `pod.spec.containers.securityContext.runAsUser`; https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod
  - `docker run --user 10000 ...` https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run
  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ecs-task-definition-nonroot-user.html
- use a static tag with digest instead of latest
  - ensure that you are using the version of the image that you expect
  - don't use e.g: `alpine:latest`, instead use an immutable image reference like `alpine:3.17.3@sha256:b6ca290b6b4cdcca5b3db3ffa338ee0285c11744b4a6abaa9627746ee3291d8d` to ensure an expected version is always used
  - version full digests can be manually resolved for consumption using `crane digest alpine:3.17.3` (for example)
  - when using systems like Knative, these digests are automatically resolved
- deploy containers with a read-only root filesystem
  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ecs-containers-readonly-access.html
  - `docker run --read-only ...`; https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run
  - set `pod.spec.containers.securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem` to `true`; https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context
